# My Portfolio Website

## What It Is
My portfolio website is a modern, responsive single-page application that showcases my skills, projects, and professional journey. It serves as my digital business card and central hub for everything about my work as a developer.

## Why I Made It
I created this portfolio to:
- Establish my online presence and personal brand
- Showcase my best work in one centralized location
- Demonstrate my technical skills through the site itself
- Make it easy for potential employers and collaborators to learn about me
- Practice and display my front-end development abilities

## How I Made It
**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML5** for semantic structure and accessibility
- **CSS3** with Flexbox/Grid for responsive layouts
- **JavaScript** for interactive elements and smooth scrolling
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- **GitHub Pages** for free hosting

**Key Features Built:**
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Smooth scroll navigation between sections
- Project gallery with hover effects
- Interactive contact form
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Loading animations and transitions

## Challenges & Learnings

### What I Struggled With:
- **Responsive Design:** Getting the layout to look good on all screen sizes required lots of testing and media queries
- **Performance Optimization:** Balancing beautiful animations with fast loading times was tricky
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring consistent appearance across different browsers
- **Accessibility:** Learning to implement proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Form Handling:** Setting up the contact form to work without a backend

### What I Learned:
- **Mobile-First Development:** Starting with mobile design makes responsive development smoother
- **CSS Variables:** How to use them for consistent theming and easy color changes
- **Git Workflow:** Better understanding of version control and deployment processes
- **Performance Best Practices:** Image optimization, minimal CSS/JS, and efficient animations
- **SEO Basics:** Proper meta tags, semantic HTML, and site structure for better visibility

This project taught me that building something for yourself is one of the best ways to learn - you encounter real-world problems and are motivated to find the best solutions.
